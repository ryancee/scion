# Release Notes (Feb 25, 2026)

This release focuses on hardening the agent provisioning pipeline, streamlining template management through automatic bootstrapping, and enhancing the web authentication experience.

## 🚀 Features
* **Template Bootstrapping:** Local agent templates are now automatically bootstrapped into the Hub database during server startup, ensuring all defined templates are consistently available across the system.
* **Custom ADK Runner Entrypoint:** Introduced a specialized runner entrypoint for Agent Development Kit (ADK) agents with native support for the `--input` flag, facilitating more robust automated execution.
* **Wildcard Subdomain Authorization:** Expanded security configuration to support wildcard subdomain matching in `authorized-domains`, allowing for more flexible deployment architectures.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Agent Provisioning & Creation:** Resolved multiple issues in the Hub-dispatched agent creation flow, including a 403 authorization fix, rejection of duplicate agent names, and a critical fix for container image resolution.
* **Instruction Injection Logic:** Improved the reliability of agent instructions by implementing auto-detection for `agents.md` and ensuring stale instruction files (e.g., lowercase `claude.md`) are removed during provisioning.
* **Web UI & Auth Persistence:** Fixed a bug where the authenticated user wasn't correctly fetched on page load, ensuring the profile and sign-out options are always visible in the header.
* **Pathing & Scoping:** Corrected path resolution logic to prevent local-path groves from incorrectly using hub-native paths, and refined the `scion delete --stopped` command to strictly scope to the active grove.
* **Environment Gathering:** Fixed a regression in the `env-gather` finalize-env flow to ensure the template slug is correctly preserved throughout the entire provisioning pipeline.
* **Configuration Schema:** Added `task_flag` support to the settings schema and Hub configuration, improving the tracking and validation of agent task states.

# Release Notes (Feb 24, 2026)

This release introduces a robust policy-based authorization system, a comprehensive agent notification framework, and significant enhancements to hub-native groves and schema validation.

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
* **Policy-Based Authorization:** Strictly enforced authorization for agent operations. Agent creation now requires grove membership, while interaction (PTY, messaging) and deletion are restricted to the agent's owner (creator) or system administrators.

## 🚀 Features
* **Agent Notifications System:** Launched a multi-phase notification framework enabling real-time subscriptions to agent status events. This includes a new notification dispatcher, Hub API endpoints, and a `--notify` flag in the CLI for status tracking.
* **Harness-Agnostic Templates:** Introduced support for role-based, harness-agnostic agent templates. New fields for `agent_instructions`, `system_prompt`, and `default_harness_config` allow templates to be defined by their role rather than specific LLM implementations.
* **GKE Security Enhancements:** Added a dedicated `gke` runtime configuration option to enable GKE-specific features like Workload Identity, streamlining secure deployments on Google Kubernetes Engine.
* **Hub-Native Workspace Management:** Advanced hub-native grove capabilities (Phase 3) with new support for direct workspace file management via the Hub API, reducing reliance on external Git repositories.
* **ADK Agent Integration:** Added a specialized example and Docker template for Agent Development Kit (ADK) agents, facilitating the development of custom autonomous agents within the Scion ecosystem.
* **Infrastructure & Models:** Upgraded the default agent model to `gemini-3-flash-preview` and introduced Cloud Build configurations for automated image delivery.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Schema & Config Synchronization:** Conducted a comprehensive audit and sync between Go configuration structs and JSON schemas. This fixes field naming inconsistencies (e.g., camelCase for `runtimeClassName`) and improves cross-platform validation.
* **Environment Variable Passthrough:** Corrected environment handling to treat empty variable values as implicit host environment passthroughs.
* **Per-Agent Hub Overrides:** Enabled agents to specify custom Hub endpoints directly in their configuration, providing flexibility for agents to report to different Hubs than their parent grove.
* **Soft-Delete Configuration:** Added explicit server-side settings for soft-delete retention periods and workspace file preservation.

# Release Notes (Feb 23, 2026)

This period focused on major architectural expansions, introducing multi-hub connectivity for runtime brokers and "hub-native" groves that decouple workspace management from external Git repositories.

## 🚀 Features
* **Multi-Hub Broker Architecture:** Completed a major refactor of the Runtime Broker to support simultaneous connections to multiple Hubs. This includes a new multi-credential store, per-connection heartbeat management, and a "combo mode" that allows a broker to be co-located with one Hub while serving others remotely.
* **Hub-Native Groves:** Launched "Hub-Native" groves, enabling the creation of project workspaces directly through the Hub API and Web UI without an external Git repository. These groves are automatically initialized with a seeded `.scion` structure and managed locally by the Hub.
* **Streamlined Workspace Creation:** Introduced a new grove creation interface in the Web UI that supports both Git-based repositories and Hub-native workspaces, including direct Git URL support for quick onboarding.
* **Improved Agent Configuration:** Enhanced the agent creation form with optimized dropdowns and more intuitive labeling, including renaming "Harness" to "Type" for better clarity.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Web UI Asset Reliability:** Resolved several issues with Shoelace icon rendering by correctly synchronizing the icon manifest, fixing asset serving paths in the Go server, and updating CSP headers to allow data-URI system icons.
* **Template Flexibility:** Updated the template push logic to make the harness type optional, facilitating the use of more generic or agnostic agent templates.
* **Codex Harness Refinement:** Improved the Codex integration by isolating harness documentation into a dedicated `.codex/` subdirectory and removing unnecessary system prompt prepending.

# Release Notes (Feb 22, 2026)

This period introduced significant data management features, including agent soft-delete and centralized harness configuration storage, while advancing the secrets management and execution limits infrastructure.

## 🚀 Features
* **Agent Soft-Delete & Restore:** Implemented a complete soft-delete lifecycle for agents. This includes Hub-side archiving, a new `scion restore` command, list filtering for deleted agents, and an automated background purge loop for expired records.
* **Secrets-Gather & Interactive Input:** Enhanced the environment gathering pipeline to support "secrets-gather." Templates can now define required secrets, and the CLI provides interactive prompts to collect missing values, which are then securely backed by the configured secret provider.
* **K8s Native Secret Mounting:** Completed Phase 4 of the secrets strategy, enabling native secret mounting for agents running in Kubernetes. This includes support for GKE CSI drivers and robust fallback paths.
* **Harness Config Hub Storage:** Added Hub-resident storage for harness configurations. This enables centralized management (CRUD), CLI synchronization, and ensures configurations are consistently propagated to brokers during agent creation.
* **Agent Execution Limits:** Introduced Phase 1 of the agent limits infrastructure, including support for `max_turns` and `max_duration` constraints and a new `LIMITS_EXCEEDED` agent state.
* **CLI UX Improvements:** Added a `--all` flag to `scion stop` for bulk agent termination, introduced Hub auth verification with version reporting, and enhanced `scion look` with better visual padding and borders.
* **Web UI & Real-time Updates:** Launched a new "Create Agent" UI, optimized frontend performance by moving to explicit component imports, and enabled real-time grove list updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Provisioning Robustness:** Improved cleanup of provisioning agents during failed or cancelled environment gathering sessions to prevent stale container accumulation.
* **Sync & State Consistency:** Fixed a race condition where Hub synchronization could remove freshly created agents and ensured harness types are correctly propagated during agent sync.
* **Deployment Pipeline:** Corrected the build sequence in GCE deployment scripts to ensure web assets are fully compiled before the Go binary is built.
* **Config Resolution:** Fixed several configuration issues, including profile runtime application, grove flag resolution in subdirectories, and Hub environment variable suppression when the Hub is disabled.

# Release Notes (Feb 21, 2026)

This period heavily focused on implementing the end-to-end "env-gather" flow to manage environment variables safely, alongside several CLI improvements and runtime fixes.

## 🚀 Features
* **Env-Gather Flow Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive environment variable gathering system across the CLI, Hub, and Broker. This includes harness-aware env key extraction, Hub 202 handling with submission endpoints, and broker-side evaluation to finalize the environment prior to agent creation.
* **Agent Context Threading:** Threaded the CLI hub endpoint directly to agent containers and added support for environment variable overrides.
* **Agent Dashboard Enhancements:** The agent details page now displays the `lastSeen` heartbeat as a relative time format.
* **Template Pathing:** Added support for `SCION_EXTRA_PATH` to optionally include template bin directories in the system `PATH`.
* **Build System Upgrades:** Overhauled the Makefile with new standard targets for build, install, test, lint, and web compilation.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Env-Gather Safety & UX:** Added strict rejection of env-gather in non-interactive modes to prevent unsanctioned variable forwarding. Improved confirmation messaging and added dispatch support for grove-scoped agent creation.
* **CLI Output Formatting:** Redirected informational CLI output to `stderr` to ensure `stdout` can be piped cleanly as JSON.
* **Podman Performance:** Fixed slow container provisioning on Podman by directly editing `/etc/passwd` instead of using `usermod`.
* **Profile Parameter Routing:** Corrected the threading of the profile parameter from the CLI through the Hub to the runtime broker.
* **Hub API Accuracy:** The Hub API now correctly surfaces the `harness` type in responses for agent listings.
* **Docker Build Context:** Fixed an issue where the `scion-base` Docker image build was missing the web package context.

# Release Notes (Feb 20, 2026)

This period focused heavily on unifying the Hub API and Web Server architectures, refactoring the agent status model, and enhancing the web frontend experience with new routing and pages.

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
* **Status Model:** Consolidated the `SessionStatus` field into the primary `Status` field across the codebase (API, Database, UI). The `WAITING_FOR_INPUT` and `COMPLETED` states are now treated as "sticky" statuses.
* **Server Architecture:** Combined the Hub API and Web server to serve on a single port (`8080`) when both are enabled. API traffic is now routed to `/api/v1/`, resolving CORS issues and simplifying local deployment.

## 🚀 Features
* **Web Frontend Enhancements:** Added a new Brokers list page, implemented full client-side routing for the Vite dev server, and unified OAuth provider detection via a new `/auth/providers` endpoint.
* **Agent Environment:** Added support for injecting harness-specific telemetry and hub environment variables directly into agent containers based on grove settings.
* **Git Operations:** Added cloning status indicators and improved git clone config parity during grove-scoped agent creation.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Real-time UI Updates:** Fixed the Server-Sent Events (SSE) format to ensure real-time UI updates correctly broadcast agent state changes.
* **Routing & Port Prioritization:** Fixed port prioritization to use the web port for broker hub endpoints in combined mode, and ensured unhandled `/api/` routes return proper JSON 404 responses.
* **OAuth & Login:** Fixed conditional rendering for the `/login` route and correctly populated OAuth provider attributes during client-side navigation.
* **Container Configuration:** Fixed container image resolution from on-disk harness configurations and normalized YAML key parsing.
* **Status Reporting:** Ensured Hub status reporting correctly respects and preserves the newly unified, sticky statuses.

# Release Notes (Feb 19, 2026)

This period represented a major architectural shift, consolidating the web server into a single Go binary, removing dependencies like NATS and Koa, and introducing hub-first remote workspaces via Git.

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
* **Secrets Management:** The system now strictly requires a configured production secret backend (e.g., `gcpsm`) for any secret Set operations across user, grove, and runtime broker scopes. Plaintext fallbacks have been removed. Read, list, and delete operations remain functional locally to support data migration.
* **Server Architecture:** The Node.js Koa server and NATS message broker dependencies have been completely retired. The Scion Hub now natively handles web frontend serving, SPA routing, and Server-Sent Events (SSE) via a consolidated Go binary.

## 🚀 Features
* **Hub-First Git Workspaces:** Implemented end-to-end support for creating remote workspaces directly from Git URLs. This integration enables git clone mode across `sciontool init` and the runtime broker pipeline.
* **Web Server & Auth Integration:** Introduced native session management and OAuth routing within the Go web server, alongside a new EventPublisher for real-time SSE streaming.
* **Telemetry & Settings:** Added telemetry injection to the `v1` settings schema. Telemetry configuration now supports hierarchical merging and is automatically bridged into the agent container's environment variables.
* **CLI Additions:** Introduced the `scion look` command for non-interactive terminal viewing. Project initialization now automatically sets up template directories and requires a global grove.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Lifecycle Hooks:** Relocated the cleanup handler to container lifecycle hooks to guarantee reliable execution upon container termination.
* **Settings Overrides:** Fixed configuration parsing to ensure environment variable overrides are correctly applied when loaded from `settings.yaml`.
* **CLI Defaults:** Ensured the `update-default` command consistently targets the global grove, and introduced a new `--force` flag.
* **Frontend Assets:** Resolved static asset serving issues by removing an erroneous `StripPrefix` in the router, and fixed client entry point imports.
