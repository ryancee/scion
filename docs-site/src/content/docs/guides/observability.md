Scion provides comprehensive observability for agent containers and system components through the `sciontool` telemetry pipeline and OpenTelemetry log bridging. This guide covers how to monitor agent activity, collect logs, and integrate with cloud-native observability platforms like Google Cloud Logging and Trace.

## Architecture Overview

Scion's observability architecture follows a "forwarder" pattern where `sciontool` acts as a local collector inside each agent container, and system components (Hub and Broker) bridge their logs directly to a central backend.

## Administrator Setup: Cloud Logging

To centralize logs and traces from all Scion components in Google Cloud, you must configure the OTLP endpoints and project identifiers.

### Connecting Hub and Broker Logs

The Scion Hub and Runtime Broker use structured logging (`slog`) with an OpenTelemetry bridge. To enable log forwarding to Google Cloud:

1.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Set the following on your Hub and Broker server processes:

    ```bash
    # Enable OTel log forwarding
    export SCION_OTEL_LOG_ENABLED=true

    # Set the GCP OTLP endpoint (standard for Cloud Trace/Logging)
    export SCION_OTEL_ENDPOINT="monitoring.googleapis.com:443"

    # Specify your GCP Project ID
    export SCION_GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    ```

2.  **Authentication**: Ensure the service account running the Hub/Broker has the following IAM roles:
    - `roles/logging.logWriter`
    - `roles/cloudtrace.agent`
    - `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`

### Configuring Agent Telemetry

Agents use `sciontool` as their init process, which includes an embedded OTLP forwarder. This forwarder must be configured to point to your cloud backend.

As an administrator, the most effective way to configure this is via **Hub Environment Variables**. When configured at the Grove or Broker level on the Hub, these variables are automatically injected into every agent container.

1.  **Set Grove/Broker Variables on the Hub**:
    ```bash
    SCION_OTEL_ENDPOINT="monitoring.googleapis.com:443"
    SCION_GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    SCION_TELEMETRY_ENABLED="true"
    ```

2.  **Harness-Specific Configuration**: If you are using agents that natively support OpenTelemetry (like `opencode`), you may need to explicitly tell the agent where to find the `sciontool` forwarder (which is `localhost` from the agent's perspective):

    - **gRPC (Default)**: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="localhost:4317"`
    - **HTTP**: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318"`

## Agent Logs

Agent logs are written to `/home/scion/agent.log` inside the container. The sciontool logging system writes to both stderr and this file.

### Log Ownership and Permissions

The `sciontool` utility ensures that `agent.log` is owned by the `scion` user during initialization, even if `sciontool` is initially run as root. The log file is created with permissive `0666` permissions to ensure multiple processes can contribute to the log stream.

### Log Levels

- **INFO**: Normal operational events
- **ERROR**: Critical failures
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information (enabled with `SCION_DEBUG=true` or `SCION_LOG_LEVEL=debug`)

## Telemetry Collection

The telemetry pipeline in sciontool collects and forwards OpenTelemetry (OTLP) data from agents. See the [Metrics & OpenTelemetry guide](/guides/metrics) for deep configuration details.

### What's Collected

| Data Type | Source | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Traces | Agent OTLP | Span data for tool calls, API requests |
| Metrics | sciontool | Counters and histograms for tokens, tools, and latency |
| Correlated Logs | sciontool | Log records linked to traces for every hook event |
| Hook Events | Harness hooks | Tool calls, prompts, model invocations converted to spans |
| Session Metrics | Gemini session files | Token counts, turn counts, tool statistics |

### Privacy Controls

By default, user prompts (`agent.user.prompt`) are excluded from telemetry to protect privacy. Additionally, sensitive attributes are automatically redacted or hashed.

- **Redacted**: `prompt`, `user.email`, `tool_output`, `tool_input`
- **Hashed**: `session_id`

## Troubleshooting for Admins

### Logs Not Appearing in GCP

1.  **Verify Endpoints**: Ensure `SCION_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is set to `monitoring.googleapis.com:443`.
2.  **Check Permissions**: Verify the Workload Identity or Service Account has `roles/logging.logWriter`.
3.  **Inspect Agent Init**: View the agent container logs (stderr) to see if `sciontool` reported a telemetry startup failure:
    ```
    [sciontool] ERROR: Failed to start telemetry: connection refused
    ```
4.  **Network Policy**: If running in Kubernetes, ensure Egress is allowed to GCP APIs.

### Missing Trace Correlation

If you see logs but they aren't linked to traces in the Cloud Trace waterfall:
1.  Ensure the agent is using the `sciontool` gRPC port (4317).
2.  Verify `SCION_OTEL_LOG_ENABLED=true` is set on the system components.
